    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>Lagos Local Bite celebrates the vibrant, flavorful, and deeply cultural food scene of Lagos, Nigeria. In a city that never sleeps, food isn’t just sustenance — it’s a way of life. From the smoky, spicy aroma of suya skewers roasting over charcoal to the sweet, warm comfort of puff-puff, Lagos street food tells the story of a city bursting with energy and community.

Our mission is to highlight the bites that define Lagos: roasted plantain (bole) paired with fiery pepper sauce, ewa agoyin (soft, mashed beans with rich pepper stew) served with the iconic Agege bread, and steamed moi moi tucked into leaves. These are more than snacks — they’re cultural touchstones passed down through generations.

But Lagos Local Bite isn’t just about tradition. We also spotlight the new wave of culinary innovation: vegan Nigerian dishes, fusion shawarma with local pepper, and modern “buka-style” joints where heritage meets creativity.

Whether you’re a local food lover, a curious traveler, or someone who simply craves bold and authentic flavors, Lagos Local Bite is your guide to experiencing the heart and soul of Lagos — one delicious bite at a time</p>
